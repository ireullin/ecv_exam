A company is streaming its high-volume billing data (100 MBps) to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. A data analyst partitioned the data on account_id to ensure that all records belonging to an account go to the same Kinesis shard and order is maintained. While building a custom consumer using the Kinesis Java SDK, the data analyst notices that, sometimes, the messages arrive out of order for account_id. Upon further investigation, the data analyst discovers the messages that are out of order seem to be arriving from different shards for the same account_id and are seen when a stream resize runs.
What is an explanation for this behavior and what is the solution?
A. There are multiple shards in a stream and order needs to be maintained in the shard. The data analyst needs to make sure there is only a single shard in the stream and no stream resize runs.
B. The hash key generation process for the records is not working correctly. The data analyst should generate an explicit hash key on the producer side so the records are directed to the appropriate shard accurately.
C. The records are not being received by Kinesis Data Streams in order. The producer should use the PutRecords API call instead of the PutRecord API call with the SequenceNumberForOrdering parameter.
