A real-time bidding company is rebuilding their monolithic application and is focusing
on serving real-time data. A large number of reads and writes are generated from
thousands of concurrent users who follow items and bid on the companyâ€™s sale
offers.
The company is experiencing high latency during special event spikes, with millions of
concurrent users.
The company needs to analyze and aggregate a part of the data in near real time to
feed an internal dashboard. 
What is the BEST approach for serving and analyzing data, considering the constraint
of the row latency on the highly demanded data?

Q81
A gas company needs to monitor gas pressure in their pipelines. Pressure data is
streamed from sensors placed throughout the pipelines to monitor the data in real
time. When an anomaly is detected, the system must send a notification to open
valve. An Amazon Kinesis stream collects the data from the sensors and an anomaly
Kinesis stream triggers an AWS Lambda function to open the appropriate valve.
Which solution is the MOST cost-effective for responding to anomalies in real time?
A. Attach a Kinesis Firehose to the stream and persist the sensor data in an Amazon
S3 bucket. Schedule an AWS Lambda function to run a query in Amazon Athena
against the data in Amazon S3 to identify anomalies. When a change is detected, the
Lambda function sends a message to the anomaly stream to open the valve.
B. Launch an Amazon EMR cluster that uses Spark Streaming to connect to the
Kinesis stream and Spark machine learning to detect anomalies. When a change is
detected, the Spark application sends a message to the anomaly stream to open the
valve.
C. Launch a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances with a Kinesis Client Library application
that consumes the stream and aggregates sensor data over time to identify 
anomalies. When an anomaly is detected, the application sends a message to the
anomaly stream to open the valve.
D. Create a Kinesis Analytics application by using the RANDOM_CUT_FOREST
function to detect an anomaly. When the anomaly score that is returned from the
function is outside of an acceptable range, a message is sent to the anomaly stream
to open the valve.

Q83
An organization has 10,000 devices that generate 100 GB of telemetry data per day, 
with each record size around 10 KB. Each record has 100 fields, and one field consists
of unstructured log data with a â€œStringâ€ data type in the English language. Some
fields are required for the real-time dashboard, but all fields must be available for
long-term generation.
The organization also has 10 PB of previously cleaned and structured data,
partitioned by Date, in a SAN that must be migrated to AWS within one month.
Currently, the organization does not have any real-time capabilities in their solution.
Because of storage limitations in the on-premises data warehouse, selective data is
loaded while generating the long-term trend with ANSI SQL queries through JDBC for
visualization. In addition to the one-time data loading, the organization needs a
cost-effective and real-time solution.
How can these requirements be met? (Choose two.)
A. use AWS IoT to send data from devices to an Amazon SQS queue, create a set of
workers in an Auto Scaling group and read records in batch from the queue to
process and save the data. Fan out to an Amazon SNS queue attached with an AWS
